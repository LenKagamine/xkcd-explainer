xkcd explainer is a Chrome extension that provides indepth explanation of xkcd comics. The explanations are retrieved from the explain xkcd wiki (http://www.explainxkcd.com/).

The explanation are taken as wikitext from a comic's respective explain wiki page (available at [explainxkcd.com/[comic id]]()). The wikitext is then parsed into HTML, which is inserted into the xkcd page below the comic. An explanation button toggles the explanation, allowing for it to be nicely concealed until it is needed.

The wikitext parser can parse the following markup:
- Headings & Subheadings
- Bold & Italics
- Bullet and sub-bullet points
- Internal links (within the explain xkcd wiki)
- Wikipedia links (defaulted to English)
- Other external links
- Quotes
- Citation needed links (links to comic #285)

Planned Features/Fixes:
- Some links don't link correctly
- Tables
